What's written below isn't exactly a "pseudo-code" but a summary of the procedure to follow for your implementation.

Method 1
=========

- Compute the mean of each seen class.

- Compute the similarity (dot product based) of each unseen class with each of the seen classes.

- Normalize the similarity vector (to that it sums to 1, since we are using a convex combination).

- Compute the mean of each unseen class using a convex combination of means of seen classes.

- Apply the model to predict labels on unseen class test inputs.

- Compute classification accuracies.


Method 2
========

- Compute the mean of each seen class.

- Learn the multi-output regression model with class attribute vector being the input and the class mean vector being the output (this will use the seen class attributes and their mean vectors).

- Apply the learned regression model to compute the mean of each unseen class.

- Apply the model to predict labels on unseen class test inputs.

- Compute classification accuracies.

- Note: You need to try several values of the regularization hyperparameter \lambda
