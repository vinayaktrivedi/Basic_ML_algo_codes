The ZIP file contains two python scripts - generative.py and generative_v2.py.

#First script runs on the dataset binclass.txt while second one runs on binclassv2.txt

#Both the datafiles must be in the same directory as the python scripts else the script will fail

#The script computes the decision boundary for unequal and equal covariance case, and plots the boundary with classes, and saves the plot in the same directory as the script.

#Sklearn library is used for implementing linear SVM, make sure it is installed.

#In order to run the scripts, simply run python {filename.py} in the shell with no command line arguments or inputs.

#Numpy, matplotlib, csv libraries are also dependencies of this script.

#Each script saves three figures in the directory, named according to their case, generative with unequal variance, generative with equal variance and of linear SVM.

#Hence after running both scripts, there should be total 6 figures in the directory.
